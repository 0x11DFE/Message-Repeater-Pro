## üöÄ How to Use

The plugin is controlled by commands sent in any chat. For details, check the FAQ inside the plugin's settings.

### General Commands

* `.spam` or `.spamdel`
    * Used with arguments, this sends a message or media multiple times.
    * **Used alone, this repeats the last spam command.**
* `.spamstop`
    * Immediately stops any active task.
* `.spamdebuglog`
    * Saves a debug log file and shows you the path.

### Text Automation

To send text repeatedly, use the format: `.spam [text] [count]`

```
.spam Hello World [50]
```

To add a delay between messages, add it in a third bracket (in seconds):

```
.spam Beep [10] [1.5]
```

### Media Automation

To repeat a photo, sticker, video, or file, **reply** to that media with the command:

```
.spam [count] [delay]
```
The delay is optional.

### Flash Mode (`.spamdel`)

This command works exactly like `.spam`, but each message is automatically deleted after a configurable delay (default is 2.5 seconds).

```
.spamdel This will flash and disappear [10]
```

## üîß Configuration

All settings, including command names and delays, can be configured by going to:
`Settings > extraGram Settings > Plugins > Message Repeater Pro`
